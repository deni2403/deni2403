# Hi there,  I'm **Deni**

I'm currently pursuing my degree in Informatics Engineering with a keen interest in web and mobile application development. I am eager to learn and explore more about new things and technology. I am seeking opportunities to further develop my skills and am also looking forward to collaborating with others to enhance my abilities. Feel free to contact me anytime through LinkedIn.

A little more about me :

  pronouns: "He" || "Him",
  code: ["HTML", "CSS", "SCSS", "Javascript", "PHP", "Dart"],
  tools: ["React", "Bootstrap", "Express.js", "Laravel", "Flutter"]
};
```
